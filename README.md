# Image-processing
Python-based image processing pipeline using OpenCV and NumPy. Includes grayscale conversion, histogram analysis, Sobel edge detection, and gradient magnitude computation. Image enhancement is achieved through cropping, Gaussian smoothing, and sharpening, applied to grayscale and color images.
