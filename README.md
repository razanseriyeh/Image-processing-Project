# Image-processing-and-computer-vision
Python-based image processing pipeline using OpenCV and NumPy. Includes grayscale conversion, histogram analysis, Sobel edge detection, and gradient magnitude computation. Image enhancement is achieved through cropping, Gaussian smoothing, and sharpening, applied to grayscale and color images.
Image Processing and Enhancement Project

This project implements an image processing pipeline in Python using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. It focuses on image analysis, edge detection, and image enhancement techniques applied to grayscale and color images.

Features

Grayscale conversion

Intensity histogram analysis (grayscale and RGB channels)

Edge detection using Sobel operators (X, Y, and gradient magnitude)

Image cropping

Noise reduction with Gaussian blur

Image sharpening using spatial convolution filters

Comparative analysis on multiple images

Technologies

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

PIL

Usage

Update the input image paths and output directories in the script, then run the program to generate processed images and analysis results.
